/// The humble node.
///
/// **Overview**
///
/// Nodes are organized in an acyclic, directed tree with children ordered by
/// [priority].
///
/// TODO: Write these docs.
///
/// **Building**
///
/// TODO: Write these docs.
///
/// **Signals**
///
/// Nodes communicate time-sensitive events through signals: named, type-safe
/// message emitters. Use one to report an event to consumers, or as an input
/// to react to external events.
///
/// Conventionally, signals are prefixed with the word `on`. For example, a
/// collision signal should be named `onCollision`. This allows consumers to
/// have a natural-reading constructor, e.g. `onCollision(/* do stuff */);`.
///
/// **Scenes**
///
/// Nodes may be mounted to a [Scene], which drives them with a game loop. When
/// mounted, the scene will propagate through the entire subtree emitting the
/// [onMount] signal on each node, from top to bottom. Unmounting does the
/// reverse, emitting the [onUnmount] signal from the leaves upward.
///
/// **Tree**
///
/// Before being mounted, the [add], [remove], and [priority] tree operations
/// take effect immediately, allowing a subtree to be freely assembled long
/// before it goes live.
///
/// Once mounted, however, the same calls are instead merely enqueued. The
/// scene applies pending changes right before the next [update]. As a result,
/// operations for live node trees are always delayed a frame. Although
/// unintuitive, this queue allows the engine to mitigate modification
/// during iteration, and improves performance by batching the changes.
///
/// **Dependency Injection**
///
/// Nodes come integrated with a type-based dependency injection (DI) system.
/// A node may [provide] a value to its entire subtree, keyed by its type.
/// [read] resolves the nearest match, checking the node itself before its
/// [ancestors].
///
/// **Reassembly**
///
/// When the world changes out from under a live tree, the scene walks it
/// calling [reassemble]. Unlike [update] and [render], the walk ignores the
/// [enabled] flag, so even disabled nodes are asked.
///
/// Currently, the walk runs in two, distinct situations:
///
///   - Whenever the `SceneWidget` reassembles in the Flutter tree.
///   - Whenever [Ignis.cache] changes, such as via the local asset bundle.
///
/// Each node answers for itself, and the default answer is nothing, so a save
/// leaves a running game exactly as it was.
class Node {
  /// Creates a new node.
  ///
  /// [enabled] controls whether the node updates and renders.
  /// Defaults to true.
  ///
  /// [priority] controls this node's order when updating and rendering.
  /// Defaults to 0.
  ///
